## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of web development. We won't be able to make you a web developer in a day but we will give you the tools to start on your journey. Remember, the Phoenix tech community and Galvanize are here to support you on this learning path! üë©‚Äçüíªüåµüë®‚Äçüíª


#### Here's what we'll be doing (Morning):
* Setting up our computers for web development
* Overview of basic HTML concepts
* Overview of CSS concepts
* Playing around in the sandbox


#### Here's what we'll be doing (Afternoon):
* Talking about the JavaScript ecosystem and it's place alongside other languages
* Overview of basic JavaScript and fundamental programming concepts
* Playing around and break things as we get hands-on in labs


#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 
It's very similar to creating a recipe that someone else then has to follow.
So let's get started telling our computer to "cook" up some awesome things for us.


## Want to Code Along With Me?


#### Please set up the following:
