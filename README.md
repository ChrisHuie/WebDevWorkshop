## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of development with JavaScript.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Talking about the JavaScript ecosystem and it's place alongside other languages
* Overview of basic JavaScript and fundamental programming concepts
* Playing around and break things as we get hands-on in labs


#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 
It's similar to creating a recipe that someone else then has to follow.
This should become more clear as we dive in :-)
